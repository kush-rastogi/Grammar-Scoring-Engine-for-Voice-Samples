# Project Summary: Grammar Scoring Engine using Wav2Vec2
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to automatically score spoken grammar on a scale of 0â€“5 using audio recordings. It leverages Facebook's Wav2Vec2 model for extracting meaningful speech representations, and uses a Random Forest classifier for predicting grammar proficiency levels.

# Key Components
Wav2Vec2 (facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h): Pretrained transformer model used to extract deep audio features from 16kHz sampled speech.

Feature Extraction: Audio files are processed into embeddings by averaging over Wav2Vec2 hidden states.

Label Encoding & Balancing: Grammar labels are encoded and the dataset is class-balanced using upsampling to handle class imbalance.

Random Forest Classifier: Trained on extracted features to predict discrete grammar scores.

# Evaluation Metrics:

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Pearson Correlation Coefficient

Confusion Matrix

Boxplot of prediction distribution (replaces traditional histogram)

# Output
Evaluation results on validation data, showing classification performance and error metrics.

Boxplot visualizing the distribution of predicted scores grouped by true labels.
